LiteFunctions gives you a function platform that stays inside your cluster and your workflow.

- Kubernetes-native control plane
- Sync and async execution
- Multi-language runtimes
- Git-driven updates and hook-based refresh for dynamic runtimes

Use the docs to install, configure, and operate the platform.
