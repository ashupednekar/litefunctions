LiteFunctions gives you a function platform that stays inside your cluster and your workflow.
It is Kubernetes-native by design, supports both synchronous HTTP requests and asynchronous event workloads,
and ships with multiple runtimes so teams can use the languages they already trust.
Deploy with Git-driven updates and keep the operational control plane in your own infrastructure.
